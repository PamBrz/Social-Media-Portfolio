                    <br>
                    <li>Online media refers to any information or content you find on the internet or through digital channels. This can be things like websites, blogs, videos, or social media posts.</li>
                    <li>Over time, online media has changed and grown. It started with things like bulletin boards and forums in the 1990s, then moved on to blogs, online news, and social media. Nowadays, we have video streaming, e-commerce, and even augmented reality.</li> 
                    <li>The development of online media is driven by technologies like 5G networks, artificial intelligence, and augmented reality. These technologies make it possible for us to do things like stream videos faster, personalize our online experiences, and even use virtual reality.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>Client/Server architecture is a network with two main roles: clients and servers.</li>
                    <li>Clients are the ones who request services or resources, while servers provide those services or resources. This model is commonly used in computer networks and systems where multiple devices need to communicate.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The client/server infrastructure is the system that makes this network possible.</li>
                    <li>It enables communcation between the clients and servers. This infrastructure involves different technologies that help the architecture to work smoothly.</li>

                    <li><u>Frontend Development</u></li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Frontend development is a part of web and software development that concentrates on creating the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of a website or application.</li>
                    <li>The main goal is to ensure a design that is visually appealing, responsive, and intuitive for users. </li>
                    <li>Frontend developers primarily work on the client side of web development, meaning they focus on designing and implementing the elements that users directly interact with in their browsers or on their devices.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A good user interface (UI) is about how the visual and interactive aspects of a product. It's considered good when it shows information and tools in a nice and easy-to-use way.</li>
                <li>User experience (UX) is about the overall experience someone has with a product. This includes how they feel and what they can do with it. A good user experience makes the whole interaction positive and efficient.</li>
            <br>
            <li>For web development, key technologies include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</li>    
            <br>
            <li><u>HTML</u> is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage</li>
            <li><u>CSS</u> layouts determine how things are organized on a webpage, including where they go, how big they are, and how they relate to each other.</li>
            <li><u>JavaScript</u> is a key part of frontend development, allowing you to add interactive elements to websites.</li>

                    <li><u>Backend Development</u></li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Backend development focuses on creating and maintaining the functionality of web and mobile applications. This includes designing, building, and managing the server-side logic, databases, and infrastructure that store and process data for these applications.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><u>Key concepts in backend development include:</u></li>
                    <li>Server, Hosting, and Deployment:</li>
                    <li>Servers provide services or resources to other computers within a network.</li>
                    <li>Hosting refers to the service of providing the infrastructure, resources, and environmen for websites or applications on the internet.</li>
                    <li>Deployment is the process of making software available for use.</li>
                <br>
                    <li>Backend Programming:</li>
                    <li><u>Node.js:</u> Node.js is a platform that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side, enabling the use of JavaScript for both frontend and backend development.</li>
                <li><u>Command Line Interface (CLI):</u> CLI programs are text-based applications that are operated through commands in a terminal or command prompt.</li>
            <li><u>Dependencies:</u> Dependencies are external modules or packages that a software project relies on to function properly. They are often pre-built components that provide specific functionalities.</li>    
        <br>
        <li>Backend development is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web and mobile applications.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>Data storage involves retaining data and keeping it safe for future use, whether it's in physical or digital form. This includes various technologies like hard drives, cloud storage, and more.</li>
                    <li>Databases are structured collections of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and management. They come in different types:</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><u>Relational Databases (RDBMS):</u>They store data in tables with rows and columns and enforce relationships between different data tables.</li>
                    <li>Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.</li>
                    <li><u>NoSQL Databases:</u> Flexible and scalable databases that don't rely on fixed schemas.</li>
                    <li><u>In-Memory Databases:</u> Store data in the computer's memory (RAM) for faster access.</li>
                    <li><u>Distributed Databases:</u> Distribute data across multiple computers or servers for better performance and reliability.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Each type of database serves different needs and has its own advantages depending on the specific requirements of the application.</li>

                    <li><u>GitHub:</u> GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories. It makes it easier to use Git by providing a user-friendly interface, collaboration tools, and additional features like issue tracking and project management.Git is a system that helps multiple developers work together on a project by managing changes to the project's files.</li>
                    <li><u>Version Control System (VCS):</u> A software that helps manage changes to files over time. It's commonly used in software development to track changes made by multiple contributors and coordinate their work.</li>
                    <li><u>JavaScript fetch method:</u> The fetch() method is used to fetch resources from the internet. It returns a promise that resolves to a Response object containing the requested data. It only rejects in case of network errors, not HTTP errors like 404. Instead, you need to check the Response object's properties to handle HTTP errors.</li>
